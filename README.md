**This Repository contains codes for my Personal Portfolio.** The site uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme for Jekyll. The theme is licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). I further modified the theme to suit my needs. I am adding more features to the theme as I go along. Feel free to use the theme for your own website.

## Pre-Requisites

Following package are needed for generating the site:

## Background

I have used jekyll posts for blog, pages for other stuff, collections for extras. I am going to modify the projects and publications to use collections. I may change some other stuff as well. I am also going to add a few more features to the theme. I will update the README as I go along.
