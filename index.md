Hello, I'm a first-year PhD student in the [**Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/)'s Computer Science and Engineering Department. I'm a member of SynerG (Systems and Networks Group)Â and have a broad interest in networks.

I received my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [**Central Institute of Technology**](https://cit.ac.in/) in Kokrajhar and was a member of the human-computer interaction group. Before that, I studied at [Cotton College](https://cottonuniversity.ac.in/) in Guwahati.
