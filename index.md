I am a final-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [**Central Institute of Technology**](https://cit.ac.in/) in Kokrajhar, where I have the honour of being advised by Assistant Proffessor [Dr. Ranjan Maity](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/dr-ranjan-maity). Computer Networks attracted my interest, as did Computing Systems and Human-Computer Interaction in general. 

My former college was [Cotton College](https://cottonuniversity.ac.in/) in Guwahati. It was here that I completed my HSLC (12th) in Science.

For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on Augmented Reality, which has the potential to revolutionise education. I also interned at ALTTC in Ghaziabad in the summer of 2021.

### Student Activities

I am a member of CIT Kokrajhar's Human-Computer Interaction Group, where I aided my senior Dhanjit Sarma with a website usability assessment. Currently, I'm working with Dipali Basumatary, a PhD scholar, to create an augmented reality software that students may use to study the Bodo language.

I am one of the coordinator of CIT Kokrajhar's AI Club.

### Fun Activities

I enjoy watching movies and anime in my spare time. I'm interested in the prospect of learning a new language, and I've recently started using Duolingo to learn Japanese. I want to learn to play the drums, and volleyball, and travel around India. <br>**কিন্তু কখনো সময় পাই না কখনো উপায় পাই না** (Copied 🤓)
