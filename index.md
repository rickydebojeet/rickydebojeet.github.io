I am a first-year Ph.D. Scholar in Computer Science and Engineering Department at the [**Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**](https://cse.iitb.ac.in/). I have done my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at the [**Central Institute of Technology**](https://cit.ac.in/) in Kokrajhar, where I have the honour of being advised by Assistant Proffessor [Dr. Ranjan Maity](https://cit.ac.in/departments/profile/cse/dr-ranjan-maity). Computer Networks attracted my interest, as did Computing Systems and Human-Computer Interaction in general. 

My former college was [Cotton College](https://cottonuniversity.ac.in/) in Guwahati. It was here that I completed my HS (12th) in Science.

For my bachelor's thesis, I worked on Augmented Reality, which has the potential to revolutionise education. I also interned at ALTTC in Ghaziabad in the summer of 2021.

### Student Activities

I was a member of CIT Kokrajhar's Human-Computer Interaction Group, where I aided my senior Dhanjit Sarma with a website usability assessment. I worked with Dipali Basumatary, a PhD scholar, to create an augmented reality software that students may use to study the Bodo language.

### Fun Activities

I'm enthusiastic about learning different languages and knowing different cultures. Recently I have been trying to pick up Japanese in my free time. I would love to explore different parts of India. I am also trying to develop new hobbies like playing an instrument and swimming.

You can check my blog for the stuffs that I do just for fun. (Not updated for a long time)
