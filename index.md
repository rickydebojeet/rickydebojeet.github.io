Hello, I'm a first-year PhD student in IIT Bombay's [Computer Science and Engineering Department](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). I'm a member of SynerG (Systems & Networking Group) and have a broad interest in networks. Currently, I'm working on improving the performance of the 5G network by changing the way packets are handled in a system.

I received my B. Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from the [Central Institute of Technology Kokrajhar](https://cit.ac.in/) in 2022 and was a member of the human-computer interaction group. Before that, I studied at [Cotton College](https://cottonuniversity.ac.in/) in Guwahati.

If I am not working on my computer, I might be watching movies, or listening to music. I am trying to pick up new hobbies and learn new things. Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about anything.
