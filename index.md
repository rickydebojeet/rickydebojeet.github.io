### Fun Activities

In my free time I like to watch movies and anime. I am fascinated by the thought of learning new language, recently I have started learning Japanese in Duolingo. I want to learn drums, play volleyball, travel India. But, sometimes there is no way, sometimes there is no time.

Stuff that I did just for fun:

- [Introduction to C#](https://github.com/rickydebojeet/introduction-to-Csharp) (with [Swaubhik Chakraborty](https://swaubhik.github.io))
