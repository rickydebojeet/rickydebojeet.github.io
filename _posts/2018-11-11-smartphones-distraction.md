# Introduction

I suppose everyone reading this post posses a smartphone. So here's a question. Are you using the smartphone or are you being used by them? I mean, if you've been paying attention, there've been lots of stories about how phones are hacking our brains and distracting us and Keeping us from focusing on what we're supposed to be doing. Former Google product manager Tristan Harris said that the apps and content of smartphones especially social media are purposefully designed to be habit-forming. An analysis carried out by Google suggests that more than 70% of the smartphone users want help with digital well-being.

## Notification Problem

Suppose you’re studying for your exam and suddenly a notification comes in your phone. What are you supposed to do? That what notification is, “a distraction”. After being provided with numerous features and abilities they still are a pain to deal with. Bad notifications are the result of bad economic incentives that have been created by bad software design, where they pop up on your lock screen, they make your phone make noise, they literally cover what you're looking at when they come in when you're using your phone. All of that stuff demands your attention and all of that attention equals real money for app makers who don't necessarily have your best interests at heart. Let’s talk about how different OSs deal with notifications. Past phones all handled notifications differently but all of those phones are dead right now. Instead, let’s just focus on how Android and iOS does things.

### Apple’s Dilemma

The apple notification system is a mess. Apple's philosophy is, "You should just let notifications flow by.” But is it true? Some notifications are super important some aren’t. But they don’t care about it and they just fill up the notification stack the order in which it was notified. Dealing with them is quite troublesome clicking it once, force tapping it, swiping it (slowly, fast) all respond to different actions. It is not the smart way the smartphone should deal with the notifications. Also, there are almost 50 combinations of settings you could set for how the notifications are dealt with in the device. That’s a hell lot of tick boxes to deal with. And I haven’t even mentioned the Do Not Disturb mode. If someone wants to figure out the notifications settings and starts to adjust the settings I suppose it would take him a month or so considering he will get bored after doing it for a while. So, then the question is, does anybody do it better? So this is the part you would know below in Android Section

### Android’s Approach

This is where Android is smarter. But there is a problem with Android. Android manufacturers are awful at sending out updates to their phones and being on the most recent version. So we can’t just say that all Android Phones are good in dealing with the notifications. Moreover, there are also different UIs and skins Android Manufacturers provide with their phones which confuse us the way the notification is notified in the devices. So, we're just gonna use the Pixel 2 as an example. Since it’s a Google phone and has the latest Android version. Let's start with the notification shade.

The Notifications are ordered by priority. So, there’s music at the top, and then there are messages, and then there's all the other garbage. So you know what's important right away. The next thing is grouping and this is the most important thing why Android notification system is better than iOS’s. Suppose I have 20 notifications from Whatsapp, they all get stacked up into one expandable notification and it can be expanded if you want. You can view, reply, or dismiss all of it, altogether, all at once.

Another special thing that Android has is if you're using the phone, some notifications instead of putting a shade down and covering the top of your screen, they could just be non-interruptive. They just pop a little icon in the notification screen, you can deal with it later, which is great.

And there’s a new feature called Categories. Which is a really complicated thing where all of an apps notification settings get put into a single screen where you can choose different notification options from all the different kinds of notification the app wants to send to you. So you can choose whether it's a high priority where it makes your phone make noise or low priority where it's silent and it doesn't get notifications at all. And you can do that, not just for the whole app, but for all the little things that an app wants to tell you. This Categories system of Android is just as bad as Notifications system in iOS. In fact, they're worse. There are so many more check-boxes on Android than there are on iOS. So, it's weird for me to praise it. The difference is that the end states, of those check-boxes for notifications, are actually way more humane, they're more in my control and they're less annoying than what happens to you on the iPhone. The other reason I'm less annoyed with Android notifications is that you can get to all those check-boxes directly from the notification itself. And yes there is DND too.
I'm not saying that Android notifications are perfect. They do need work also. In fact, I would love to see some of that fancy machine learning that Google's always talking about, applied more to the problem notifications.

# Digital Wellbeing and Further Initiatives

Guess what, companies like Google, Apple are taking the digital wellbeing very seriously they believe that “Great technology should improve life, not distract from it.” They are incorporating tools and features that help people better understand their tech usage, focus on what matters most, disconnect when needed, and create healthy habits for the whole family.

There is a whole new digital well-being section in the settings of the latest Android Pie that learns more about the time we spent in the particular app using machine learning.

The youtube app has got features like take a break, time spent and notification management in settings that will encourage us in stepping away from wasting a lot of time in it.

There is a really interesting story on people grey screening their phones so that all the colour doesn't hack their lizard brains. And interestingly google incorporated the feature in the latest version of Android.

There are apps like Family Link that manages what apps kids use, track screen use time and customize kid’s experience.

The movement called Time Well Spent provides many more ideas for the digital wellbeing. It was started by Tristan Harris, who was a design ethicist at Google, and I don't disagree with any of it. It is possible, for your phone, to put you in a permanent state of distraction. You should only give them that power if they deliver something really valuable to you and too often they don't.

# Conclusion

Notifications, they're the new email. They're just as important. But, email has got many tools for managing messages. It has folders for sorting, stars, archiving, snoozing, etc. We need to be empowered to manage our notifications, just like we're empowered to manage our email. Or we need a whole different approach to solve this problem entirely.
